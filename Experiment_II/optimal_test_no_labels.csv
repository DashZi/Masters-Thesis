433,1,2,user,"The only thing is that my dates are not flexible, I can only by from work (aka hell-hole) from August 30th to September 11th. And i was hoping to leave for 11 days
Do you have anything to Santos in that time frame?"

433,3,6,user,My other destination is Hiroshima

443,1,1,wizard,That is ok :slightly_smiling_face: I will guide you through it. I’m here to help you find the best vacation packages to fit your needs. Maybe we can start by you telling me where you are located and where you would like to explore travel options to.

443,2,10,user,"1700, I wish I could spend more but I'm a writer and my last book was a total flop you know. I'm travelling to work on my book so if you could find places that were calm that would be really nice. I need this one to be a masterpiece!"
443,2,11,wizard,"Ok! Well sadly I cannot find you a package in Chicago for that budget, so perhaps you could tell me your other destination possibility and we can explore your options there."
443,3,12,user,"Ok, the other place I was thinking of is Baltimore"
443,3,13,wizard,For just a little more than your budget I can book you 13 days at the Countryside Inn. This would cost 1747.67USD for the three of you and you would be in Baltimore from Sept 2-14.

696,1,3,wizard,"The cheapest option in Sacramento for that many people is Salt Water Inn at 15399.53USD, so Sacramento is not within your budget."

1139,1,7,wizard,"I can’t find anything between those dates unfortunately, could you return a couple days later?"
1139,1,8,user,What if I try a different destination between those dates?
1139,1,9,wizard,Where would you like to try?
1139,2,10,user,Los Angeles.
1139,2,11,wizard,"Nothing, sorry. It seems the dates are the issue."
1139,1,12,user,Okay let's stick with Punta Cana. I guess we could be a bit flexible with the dates.
1139,1,13,wizard,Great :slightly_smiling_face: Is there a maximum amount of days you would like to travel?
1139,1,14,user,"Not really, but something as close to the original dates as possible would be great. So maybe about 5 or so days would be good."
1139,1,15,wizard,The shortest I seem to find is 12 days from Sept 6-17.
1139,2,16,user,What if I go to Los Angeles?
1139,2,17,wizard,I can do 10 days in Los Angeles from Sept 8-17.

1156,1,3,wizard,I have good news for you! We have a 4 star hotel in the heart of Milan close to the cathedral and museum. With your budget you can stay there for 8 days.
1156,2,4,user,"ah - very nice. Um, so what are the amenities?"
1156,2,5,wizard,The hotel offers free wifi and breakfast during your stay.

1156,5,12,user,So I suppose I would like that as well..But can I check Santiago packages real quick before I do anything
1156,5,13,wizard,I'm sorry to inform you that there's nothing that matches your selections in Santiago. Would you like to go with one of your first two choices?
1156,2,14,user,that's fine.. at least the other two options are nicer. Could you tell me the guest rating for the Milan hotel?
1156,2,15,wizard,It has gathered an amazing 8.37/10 average rating from previous guests.
1156,2,16,user,"I think I would prefer that one. Italy sounds far more exotic than California anyway

1161,1,9,wizard,DO you have another destination in mind?
1161,1,10,user,"No I don't. Thanks for your help anyway, Good day."

1202,3,11,wizard,3 stars. It's the best we have.
1202,3,12,user,That’s fine ; I am but a mere writer after all. And the length of stay certainly trumps the quality of residence. Please book it.
1202,3,13,wizard,Perfect! I'ts been booked! Enjoy your stay :slightly_smiling_face:
