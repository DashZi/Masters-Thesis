# Do Large Language Models Extrapolate Personas of Dialogue Participants from Context?
supervised by: Prof. Dr. Benno Stein, Jun.-Prof. Dr. Maurice Jakesch and Marcel Gohsen


## Raised research questions:

RQ1: To what extent can a large language model predict a decision of a persona inferred solely from prior dialogue turns?
RQ2: How many preceding dialogue turns of a persona are needed for a large language model to predict the persona’s decision accurately or generate persona-aligned next utterances?
RQ3: To what extent can a large language model generate the next utterance of a persona that accurately aligns with the persona’s next action in a dialogue?
